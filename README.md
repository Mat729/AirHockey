# AirHockey
A project made during physic programming lessons to study how physic works in Unreal Engine 5

We simulated an air hockey table with impulsive forces applied in the direction we want to move the paddle; than we added a bumper to simulate a strong bouncing of the disk.
We also studied the collision presets and created our own custom collisions so that we could personalize the behaviour of the simulation
